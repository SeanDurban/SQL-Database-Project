# SQL-Database-Project

This was an individual project which I aimed to increase my knowledge of relational databases and get experience with more advanced parts such as triggers. 

I used Oracle DB to create my database (all SQL commands can be found in the .sql file).

The included PDF is a report on all aspects of the system.
